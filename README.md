## What I'm searching or trying to do:
I've noticed that one of the biggest difficulties that we have when interacting with hardcore qualitative data is the amount of reading it needs to be done to find somewhat insightful findings. Anthropologist find some sort of morbid pleasure in the *depth* of their findings, the result of an extensive fieldwork with very intimate interviews suddenly condensed in one sentence. However, most of the time, this findings have little to no correlation to the quantitative data found in the same field.

### Not so important but maybe a little bit...
I'm a very political being, I think that politics are a natural part of our development as humans and as a society. Nothing its outside politics. In relationship to computers this means **liberate all software** standpoint.
