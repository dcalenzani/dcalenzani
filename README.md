- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel or Dani
- 👀 I’m interested in analyzing unestructured data 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (Blessed be Dr.Chuck), SQL and 'data analytics' 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating data visualizations and learning materials

## Myself in a bit more depth:
I was born in Lima, Perú, in 1995. This where very convoluted times for my country and with the new millenia my dad also lost his job. One of my first memories was seeing in the news Alejandro Toledo extending his arms (his classical pose). While my dad searched for a job and my mom tried to sell cosmetics to their friends, I used to stay with my aunt, she had the first PC of my family and she even bought me a game (Jazz Jackrabbit) which I never quite learned how to play. I remember seeing her us command prompt to access the game and thinking **maybe some day I can do this too**

## What I'm searching or trying to do:
I've studied cultural anthropology as a profession and I've noticed that one of the biggest difficulties that we have when interacting with hardcore qualitative data is the amount of reading it needs to be done to find somewhat insightful findings. Anthropologist find some sort of morbid pleasure in the *depth* of our findings, the result of an extensive fieldwork with very intimate interviews **cannot** be translated in just a few senteces, at the same time, qualitative findings do not always have a correlations with quantitative findings... but perhaps...
> I think this is where computers and coding come into work. I'm still quite new in this field, but I'm eager into creating a model for analyzing cultural data through the lens of data analysis, merging what can be found through primary fonts (interviews, fieldwork, focus groups, etc.) and secondary fonts (navigational following, online datasets, etc.)

### Not so important but maybe a little bit...
I'm a very political being, I think that politics are a natural part of our development as humans and as a society. Nothing its outside politics. In relationship to computers this means I think **piracy is ok, specially if you pirate microsoft**.
