- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel or Dani
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in analyzing unestructured data
- ðŸŒ±I seriously think that descentralized digital technologies can help the working class in their fights against multinationals.But knowledge and material growth are necessary to overcome the inequalities that exist today. For FOSS to really work we also need to free the hardware!

## What I'm searching or trying to do:
I'm trying to bring technology to weird places. Social sciences, my home, is the start of the journey, I want anthropologist to abandon Atlas.Ti and SPSS and start using FOSS tools, then we can start thinking in how to bring this things to the populations we work with. Can you imagine a Farmers community in the Andes with their own data server sharing their agricultural data with other communities? I can, and I believe in data sovereignity.

### Not so important but maybe a little bit...
I'm a very political being, I think that politics are a natural part of our development as humans and as a society. Nothing its outside politics.

## Current personal projects:
- AcaCrawler - Scielo crawler and data organizer
- Dropplet, an IOT gardening helper
